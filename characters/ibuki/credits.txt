This rip aims to be the highest quality possible on AO2 and in general. No downscaling or upscaling was applied nor necessary with any AO version starting with 2.8. This file *must* be located in the same folder as the character's char.ini - removing attribution will be immediately noticed. It is easy to discover stolen sprites.
